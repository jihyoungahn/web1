  <p>True to its nature as the most intense primary color, the origin of red’s name is something of a mystery. While the term first used to describe red was the Proto-Indo-European word reudh-, the truth is that the word “red” is something of a linguistic artifact. No one is certain how this word came to be; as such, red remains a link between us and ancient history. True enough, it seems that red has been a staple since the dawn of time. Ancient Egypt proclaimed red, a color of life and celebration (as well as, notably, destruction and evil), while the Byzantines wore it in their clothing as a status symbol. Regardless of time and place, one thing is clear: the meaning of red is highly intense – and highly polarized.
