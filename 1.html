  <p><strong>Green</strong> is a cool color that symbolizes <u>nature and the natural world</u>.Perhaps because of its strong associations with nature, green is often thought to represent tranquility,good luck, health, and jealousy.

  <p style="margin-top:30px;">Researchers have also found that green can improve reading ability.
  Some students may find that laying a transparent sheet of green paper over reading material increases
  reading speed and comprehension. Green has long been a symbol of fertility and was once the preferred color
  choice for wedding gowns in the 15th-century. Even today, green M&M's (an American chocolate candy)
  are said to send a sexual message.</p>
